# Note: API keys should be set as Supabase secrets via the Dashboard, not CLI
# The Supabase CLI is not available in this environment.
# 
# To set these secrets:
# 1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard)
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Navigate to Settings > Edge Functions
# 4. In the "Secrets" section, add the following secrets:

# Gemini API Key (for AI chat and lesson generation)
# Secret name: GEMINI_API_KEY
# Secret value: your_gemini_api_key

# Eleven Labs API Key (for text-to-speech)
# Secret name: ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY
# Secret value: your_eleven_labs_api_key

# Tavus API Keys (for personalized videos)
# Secret name: TAVUS_API_KEY
# Secret value: your_tavus_api_key

# Secret name: TAVUS_REPLICA_ID
# Secret value: your_tavus_replica_id

# Secret name: TAVUS_PERSONA_ID

# Development Note:
# If you see "Tracking Prevention blocked access to storage" errors,
# this is normal in development and won't affect production.
# The app will still work but sessions won't persist between browser restarts.

# Troubleshooting:
# If you get "Invalid access token" errors for Tavus:
# 1. Verify your TAVUS_API_KEY is correct in the Supabase Dashboard
# 2. Check your Tavus account has sufficient credits
# 3. Ensure your replica and persona IDs are valid
# 4. Make sure all secrets are properly set in the Supabase Dashboard
